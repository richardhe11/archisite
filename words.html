The sea was gentle this afternoon, and as he sat in the same seat (drinking the same drink), the sounds of the sun wafted along his street—a bicycle’s bell as it rode past; a street painter’s brush strokes by the sea-side; a couple, giggling and laughing, the leaves under their feet cracking and crunching to the light rhythm of boots and cobblestone."</td>

										It’s a small mirror, the kind you’d use on your desk if you didn’t want to look at yourself. We hadn’t any use for it before we hung it up—in fact, I don’t even remember if it was on sale or not. It sat just behind the cabinets, facing the sliding door, balancing precariously on the slab of wood some idiot put in to mess with tall people." </td>
